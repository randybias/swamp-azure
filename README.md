Azure infrastructure management for [Swamp](https://swamp.club), covering 38 model types across compute, networking, data services, security, RBAC, Azure Policy, Defender for Cloud, Entra ID directory, monitoring, DNS, DevOps, Azure AI Foundry (accounts, model deployments, projects, quota), AI Search, Cosmos DB, Static Web Apps, Service Bus, Event Grid, subscription-wide topology visualization, and the Azure AI Vision Face REST API for identity-aware room services. Most methods run through the Azure CLI as a subprocess, so authentication delegates to whatever `az login` session is active on the machine and there is nothing proprietary sitting between you and your subscription. The one exception is `azure-face`, a data-plane REST type authenticated by a per-resource subscription key supplied via vault (see Vault setup below).

Container Apps, Container Apps Jobs, and Azure Container Registry are covered by the companion extension [`@rkcoleman/azure-containers`](https://github.com/rkcoleman/swamp-azure-containers), which is designed to compose with these models.

The extension goes beyond standard CRUD. The topology model performs subscription-wide inventory across 16 resource types, generates Azure-branded Mermaid diagrams of resource group network architecture, estimates monthly costs against the public Azure Retail Pricing API, and exports ARM templates for IaC documentation. The DNS model handles zone and record lifecycle with enum-validated record types. The DevOps model covers projects, repos, pipelines, builds, and work items so you can wire CI/CD operations into the same workflows that manage the infrastructure those pipelines deploy to.

Most models include a `sync` method that refreshes stored state without making changes, which means you can keep your swamp data current with what actually exists in Azure and use CEL expressions to reference live resource attributes in downstream workflows.

| `sync` | Refresh stored state without making changes |
| `create` | Create a storage account with SKU and kind |
| `delete` | Delete a storage account |

### azure-managed-identity

Covers workload identity federation as well as identity lifecycle: federated credentials let GitHub Actions, Kubernetes, or any OIDC issuer exchange its own token for the identity — no stored secret. `createFederatedCredential` matches the incoming token by exact `subject` or, on az CLI 2.87+, by a preview wildcard `claimsMatchingExpression` (exactly one of the two).

| Method | Description |

| `createFederatedCredential` | Add a federated credential (issuer + subject or claims-matching expression); idempotent |
| `deleteFederatedCredential` | Remove a federated credential; idempotent |

### azure-ad-user

Tenant-scoped (Entra ID) — authenticates via the active `az login` session, no subscription. Reads, plus a security-conscious `provision` write.

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `list` | List users, optionally narrowed by an OData `$filter` |
| `get` | Get a user by UPN or object id |
| `sync` | Refresh stored state without making changes |
| `getMemberGroups` | List the groups a user belongs to (access review) |
| `provision` | Create a user from non-secret fields via Microsoft Graph. A single-use temp password is generated in-process, sent in the request body (never in argv), set with force-change-on-next-sign-in, then discarded — never an input, returned, logged, persisted, or vaulted. The method persists nothing |

`provision` is the deliberate inverse of credential-bearing service-principal/app creation: a person's temp password is ephemeral, so nothing is kept; a service principal's minted secret is long-lived, so it would be captured into a vault. Guarded by a `live` `directory-access` pre-flight check (skip with `--skip-check-label live`).

### azure-ad-group

Tenant-scoped (Entra ID). Membership writes (`addMember`/`removeMember`) and group lifecycle (`create`/`delete`) touch live directory state — adding a member can grant access through group-based RBAC.

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `list` | List groups, optionally narrowed by an OData `$filter` |
| `get` | Get a group by object id or display name |
| `sync` | Refresh stored state without making changes |
| `listMembers` | List the member principals of a group |
| `addMember` | Add a user, group, or service principal to a group |
| `removeMember` | Remove a principal from a group |
| `create` | Create a new group |
| `delete` | Delete a group |

### azure-ad-service-principal

Tenant-scoped (Entra ID). Read-only — `create-for-rbac` is excluded because it emits secret material. `listCredentials` surfaces credential `endDateTime` for expiry auditing; secret values are never returned by Graph.

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `list` | List service principals (require one of all/displayName/filter/spn) |
| `get` | Get a service principal by appId or object id |
| `sync` | Refresh stored state without making changes |
| `listCredentials` | List password/certificate credential metadata for expiry auditing |
| `listOwners` | List the owners of a service principal |

### azure-ad-app-registration

Tenant-scoped (Entra ID). Read-only. `listCredentials` is the primary tool for catching expiring app secrets before they break an integration; secret values are never returned by Graph.

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `list` | List app registrations, optionally narrowed by displayName or `$filter` |
| `get` | Get an app registration by appId or object id |
| `sync` | Refresh stored state without making changes |
| `listCredentials` | List password/certificate credential metadata for expiry auditing |
| `listOwners` | List the owners of an app registration |

### azure-role-assignment

The direct complement to `azure-managed-identity` — granting an identity access to a Key Vault, Storage account, or resource group is a role assignment. Mutations change who can do what; verify principal, role, and scope first. On az CLI 2.87+ `list` also returns assignments inherited from management groups, and `fillPrincipalName: false` / `fillRoleDefinitionName: false` skip the per-row Graph and ARM name lookups for fast bulk audits.

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `list` | List role assignments at the subscription, a resource group, or an explicit scope |
| `listDenyAssignments` | List deny assignments — Azure-managed blocks that override any role grant (read-only) |
| `create` | Grant a principal a role at a scope |
| `delete` | Revoke a role assignment by its fully-qualified id |
| `listDefinitions` | List role definitions (optionally custom-only) |
| `getDefinition` | Get a role definition by role name (e.g. Contributor) |

### azure-policy

Governance via Azure Policy. Assignment mutations change enforcement — a Deny-mode assignment can block resource operations.

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `listAssignments` | List policy assignments at the subscription or a resource group |
| `getAssignment` | Get a policy assignment by name |
| `createAssignment` | Assign a policy or initiative at a scope |
| `deleteAssignment` | Remove a policy assignment by name |
| `listDefinitions` | List policy definitions (use `customOnly` to skip the built-in catalog) |
| `getDefinition` | Get a policy definition by name |
| `listSetDefinitions` | List policy initiatives (set definitions) |

### azure-vwan

The vWAN model manages the full hub-and-spoke topology as a set of interdependent resources, from the WAN itself through virtual hubs, hub-to-VNet connections, VPN sites, and VPN gateways.

| Method | Description |

| `get` | Get a resource group by name |
| `create` | Create a resource group in a location |
| `delete` | Delete a resource group and all its contents |

### azure-topology

The topology model operates at the subscription level rather than on individual resources. The `inventory` method discovers all resources across 16 Azure resource types and produces per-resource data handles that downstream workflows can reference. The `generate` method builds Mermaid diagrams with Azure-branded colors and resource relationship mapping. The `costEstimate` method calls the Azure Retail Pricing API directly (no authentication required) to estimate monthly spend for VMs and firewalls. The `exportTemplate` method pulls the full ARM template for a resource group.

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `inventory` | Discover all resources across the subscription (or a single resource group) |
| `generate` | Produce a Mermaid diagram of network topology with Azure-branded colors |
| `costEstimate` | Estimate monthly VM and firewall costs via the Azure Retail Pricing API |
| `exportTemplate` | Export the full ARM template for a resource group |

### azure-face

The Face model wraps the [Azure AI Vision Face REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/face/) for identity-aware room services (IARS). It is the only type in this extension that does not shell out to `az` — it is a data-plane REST service authenticated by a per-resource subscription key, so it carries its own fetch-based client and its own global arguments (`endpoint`, `key`) supplied from vault. The recognition pipeline is: a camera frame goes to `detect` (returns ephemeral faceIds), those faceIds go to `identify` (1:N match against a PersonGroup), and the matched Person's `userData` field carries the Entra objectId that the downstream `iars-correlate` workflow consumes to load the right AV scene.

`detect` works at all Face subscription tiers today. `identify`, `addPersonFace`, and `trainPersonGroup` are gated behind Microsoft's [Limited Access](https://aka.ms/facerecognition) program for the Face API and will return HTTP 401 until that approval is in place. `detectLiveness` is a documented stub — Azure liveness is a client-side SDK session flow, not a single REST call.

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `detect` | Detect faces in an image URL; returns ephemeral faceIds for `identify` |
| `identify` | 1:N identify faceIds against a PersonGroup; top candidate `userData` = Entra objectId (Limited Access) |
| `createPersonGroup` | Create a PersonGroup for enrollment |
| `listPersonGroups` | List all PersonGroups under the Face resource |
| `deletePersonGroup` | Delete a PersonGroup and all its Persons/faces (destructive) |
| `addPerson` | Add a Person with `userData` set to the Entra objectId |
| `addPersonFace` | Enroll a face image for a Person (Limited Access) |
| `listPersons` | List enrolled Persons in a PersonGroup |
| `trainPersonGroup` | Trigger training after enrollment changes (Limited Access) |
| `getPersonGroupTrainingStatus` | Poll training status until `succeeded` |
| `detectLiveness` | Stub — liveness requires the Azure AI Vision Face client SDK session flow |

### azure-ai-foundry

Azure AI Foundry and the AI Services accounts it is built on. `listDeployments` is a fan-out — omit `accountName` to sweep every account in the subscription in one run. Foundry projects and connections are read over ARM (the CLI does not expose them yet). Account keys are never fetched; data-plane credentials belong in vaults, following the `azure-face` pattern.

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `listAccounts` | List AI Services / Cognitive Services accounts, optionally filtered by kind (AIServices, OpenAI, Face, ...) |
| `getAccount` | Get a single account |
| `syncAccount` | Refresh stored account state without making changes |
| `listDeployments` | List model deployments on one account, or fan out across every account in scope |
| `createDeployment` | Deploy a model (name, version, format, SKU, capacity); idempotent |
| `deleteDeployment` | Remove a model deployment; idempotent |
| `listProjects` | List Foundry projects on an account (AIServices kind) |
| `listConnections` | List Foundry connections on an account (metadata only, no secrets) |
| `listModels` | Snapshot the deployable model catalog for a region as one resource |

| `get` | Get a search service |
| `sync` | Refresh stored state without making changes |

| `get` | Get a Static Web App |
| `sync` | Refresh stored state without making changes |

swamp extension pull @dougschaefer/azure
```

## Setup

All models authenticate through the Azure CLI, so you need `az` installed and an active login session before running any methods.

1. Install the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and authenticate:

```bash
az login
```

2. Create a swamp vault and store your subscription ID:

```bash
swamp vault create azure --type local_encryption
swamp vault set azure SUBSCRIPTION_ID <your-subscription-id>
```

3. Create a model instance, wiring the subscription ID from vault:

```bash
swamp model create @dougschaefer/azure-vm my-vms --json
```

When prompted for the `subscriptionId` global argument, use the vault expression `${{ vault.get('azure', 'SUBSCRIPTION_ID') }}`. You can also set a default resource group at this point, which saves you from passing it on every method call.

4. Run methods against the instance:

```bash
swamp model method run my-vms list --json
```

For the DevOps model, you will need a separate vault entry for your organization URL:

```bash
swamp vault set azure-devops ORG_URL https://dev.azure.com/your-org
```

The `azure-face` model does not use the `az` session. Create a dedicated vault and store the Face resource endpoint and subscription key:

```bash
swamp vault create azure-face --type local_encryption
swamp vault set azure-face endpoint https://<resource>.cognitiveservices.azure.com
swamp vault set azure-face key <subscription-key>
```

Wire them into the instance global arguments as `${{ vault.get(azure-face, endpoint) }}` and `${{ vault.get(azure-face, key) }}`. `detect` works on any tier; `identify`/enrollment/training require Microsoft Limited Access.

The Entra ID models (`azure-ad-*`) are tenant-scoped rather than subscription-scoped: they take no `subscriptionId` and run `az ad` against whatever tenant your `az login` session is signed in to. They require directory read permissions (e.g. Directory Readers / `Directory.Read.All`), and credential and membership writes require the corresponding directory roles. The `azure-defender` model requires the Security Reader role to read posture, and Security Admin to change pricing tiers.

## API Compatibility

All operations shell out to Azure CLI 2.x via `Deno.Command` subprocess with an args array (no shell interpolation). The topology model's `costEstimate` method calls the [Azure Retail Pricing API](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/cost-management/retail-prices/azure-retail-prices) directly via fetch, which is public and requires no authentication.

Tested against Azure CLI 2.67+ and the current Azure Resource Manager API versions as of March 2026. Resource group operations and ARM template export use whichever API versions the installed CLI targets.
